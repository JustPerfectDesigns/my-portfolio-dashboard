						and I'm proud to have worked with top brands like Jumia, PEP, Africa
						Strategy Advisor, and JustPerfect Designs, serving clients from all
						over the world.
						<br />
						<br />
						My passion for creating and building things with my own hands from
						scratch led me to pursue a career in graphic design. Despite
						financial challenges that prevented me from completing my education,
						I was determined to succeed and took on many responsibilities as a
						teenager. I quickly transitioned into UI design 7 years ago, and
						established myself as a top UI designer in Nigeria.
						<br />
						<br />
						I didn't stop there, I wanted to bring my designs to life and
						decided to become a frontend developer. Since over 5 years, I've
						become proficient in working with over 15 JavaScript libraries and
						frameworks. I'm known for my ability to get things done quickly, my
						commitment to writing clean efficient code, and my ability to see
						every project and firm as an opportunity to grow and learn.
						<br />
						<br />
						My passion for design and development is matched only by my
						dedication to my family. I come from a family of five, including my
						mother, two sisters, and a late father. Despite the challenges I've
						faced, I've remained focused on my goals and have become a role
						model for young people in Nigeria and around the world.
